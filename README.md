To - do
=======

##Troop Selecting / Outlining
* Make it so troops that were just converted this turn can still move.
* Grey out a troop when it is selected
* Make it so clicking on one troop when another is selected will select the second troop (assuming the currently selected troop cannot heal/unseal tp)
* Desired behavior when running out of moves: Deselect current pet, disable further selection of pets. 

##General QoL fixes
* Make it more obvious when no turns remain.
* Make the combat log more visually obvious (e.g. boldface)
* Add back colors for each rank (Villager, Defender, ...)
* Make the outline around each game tile about a pixel smaller (or alternatively make the black lines between cells a little thicker)
* Better helper functions (e.g. for checking location / equality of pets)
* toString() for MeriPet

##General Bugs
* There is a missed case if it is possible to both heal TPseal and healseal, so it is not always possible to heal correctly.
* The error text is wrong when trying to select fewer than 5 pets for the next battle.
* Selecting / Unselecting a pet causes the mission info to wiggle back and forth a little bit.
* Selecting a pet technically redraws the grey "selected" overlay box a pixel too large, but it looks fine so I didn't bother to change it.
* Selecting a pet after you run out of moves causes pet to remain greyed out. More to the point, clicking on a pet after you run out of moves does not deselect it.
